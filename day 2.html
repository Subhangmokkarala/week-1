  <h1>About me</h1>
  <h2>--Programmer--</h2>
  <p class="idk">Hi, I'm M.Subhang, a passionate student pursuing full-stack development and machine learning. I have a keen interest in exploring the fascinating world of technology and constantly expanding my knowledge in these domains.

    As a full-stack development student, I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. I strive to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces while ensuring the seamless functionality of the underlying systems. I find joy in crafting code that brings ideas to life and solving complex problems through programming.
    
    Additionally, I am an enthusiastic machine learning student. I find the concept of teaching computers to learn and make predictions incredibly intriguing. Exploring algorithms, data analysis, and pattern recognition excites me as I dive into the realm of artificial intelligence.
    
    When I'm not immersed in coding or exploring machine learning, you can find me indulging in my love for sci-fi TV shows. I find the imaginative storytelling and futuristic concepts captivating. It's a great way for me to unwind and fuel my creativity.
    
    I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills. I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and grow within the tech industry, as I strive to make a positive impact through innovative solutions.
